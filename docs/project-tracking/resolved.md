### A-20260625-install-and-dogfood — install workspace-os and use it natively
- Workstream: skills
- Status: done
- Created: 2026-06-25
- Completed: 2026-06-26
- Commit: n/a (klapp tracking left staged-ready)

Installed via marketplace + `/plugin install`; native skills confirmed by running `/project-init` on klapp (first live dogfood).

### A-20260626-sp2a-memory-core — SP2a: memory conventions + /project-init scaffold + /ingest
- Workstream: memory
- Status: done
- Created: 2026-06-26
- Completed: 2026-06-26
- Commit: 4a758e3..4613206 (branch sp2-memory)

Built subagent-driven, all tasks reviewed clean: `conventions/memory.md` (schema + boundary test + retrieval SoT), `/project-init` scaffolds `docs/memory/` + `@import`, `/ingest` captures a fact. Live klapp dogfood pending before PR merge. Decision: D-20260626-repo-canonical-memory.
